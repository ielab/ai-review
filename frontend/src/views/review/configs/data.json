    "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms after Exposure to Two Fire Disasters: Comparative Study",
    "abstract": "This study investigated traumatic stress symptoms in severely burned survivors of two fire disasters and two comparison groups of patients with 'non-disaster' burn injuries, as well as risk factors associated with acute and chronic stress symptoms. Patients were admitted to one out of eight burn centers in The Netherlands or Belgium. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was administered to 61 and 33 survivors respectively of two fire disasters and 54 and 57 patients with 'non-disaster' burn etiologies at 2 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the event. We used latent growth modeling (LGM) analyses to investigate the stress trajectories and predictors in the two disaster and two comparison groups. The results showed that initial traumatic stress reactions in disaster survivors with severe burns are more intense and prolonged during several months relative to survivors of 'non-disaster' burn injuries. Excluding the industrial fire group, all participants' symptoms on average decreased over the two-year period. Burn severity, peritraumatic anxiety, and dissociation predicted the long-term negative outcomes only in the industrial fire group. In conclusion, fire disaster survivors appear to experience higher levels of traumatic stress symptoms in the short term, but the long-term outcome appears dependent on factors different from the first response. Likely, younger age and several beneficial post-disaster factors such as psychosocial aftercare, social support, and swift judicial procedures contributed to the positive outcome in one disaster cohort.",

    "title": "Stress Detection for PTSD via the StartleMart Game",
    "abstract": "Computer games have recently shown promise as a diagnostic and treatment tool for psychiatric rehabilitation. This paper examines the positive impact of affect detection and advanced game technology on the treatment of mental diagnoses such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). For that purpose, we couple game design and game technology with stress detection for the automatic profiling and the personalized treatment of PTSD via game-based exposure therapy and stress inoculation training. The PTSD treatment game we designed forces the player to go through various stressful experiences while a stress detection mechanism profiles the severity and type of PTSD via skin conductance responses to those in-game stress elicitors. The initial study and analysis of 14 PTSD-diagnosed veteran soldiers presented in this paper reveals clear correspondence between diagnostic standard measures of PTSD severity and skin conductance responses. Significant correlations between physiological responses and subjective evaluations of the stressfulness of experiences, represented as pair wise preferences, are also found. We conclude that this supports the use of the simulation as a relevant treatment tool for stress inoculation training. This points to future avenues of research toward discerning between degrees and types of PTSD using game-based diagnostic and treatment tools.",
